## 📝 Script (with timing cues)

### [0:00 - 0:30] **Opening & Problem Statement**

**[0:00]**
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to present **ReferHarmony** - a revolutionary healthcare referral and care navigation system that's transforming how patients access care."

**[0:10]**
"Let me start with a question: How many of you have experienced the frustration of navigating healthcare referrals? The endless phone calls, the confusion about which provider to see, the uncertainty about costs and coverage?"

**[0:20]**
"These pain points are exactly what ReferHarmony solves. We've built an AI-powered platform that bridges the gap between patients, providers, and insurance - making healthcare navigation seamless, transparent, and efficient."

---

### [0:30 - 1:30] **Solution Overview & Core Value Proposition**

**[0:30]**
"ReferHarmony is a comprehensive healthcare coordination platform with three core components:"

**[0:35]**
"**First**, a referral management system that digitizes and streamlines the entire referral process - from creation to completion."

**[0:45]**
"**Second**, an AI-powered route optimization engine that creates the most efficient, cost-effective care pathways for patients."

**[0:55]**
"**And third**, a provider dashboard that gives healthcare professionals real-time visibility into patient care routes and progress."

**[1:05]**
"What makes ReferHarmony unique is our **AI Route Optimizer**. When a patient needs multiple services - say, a primary care visit, cardiology consultation, and lab work - our system doesn't just list providers. It creates an optimized route that minimizes travel time, reduces costs, and maximizes insurance coverage."

**[1:20]**
"This isn't just convenience - it's about improving health outcomes by removing barriers to care."

---

### [1:30 - 3:00] **Key Features & Demo Walkthrough**

**[1:30]**
"Let me walk you through the key features:"

**[1:35]**
"**For Patients:** When a patient needs care, they simply enter their information - name, insurance, and location. Our system automatically:
- Verifies insurance eligibility
- Matches services with covered providers
- Calculates distances and travel costs
- Generates an optimized route with cost breakdowns
- Provides a unique Route ID for tracking"

**[1:55]**
"The patient sees everything upfront: total cost, travel expenses, service costs, estimated time, and distance. They can even customize their route by excluding certain services."

**[2:05]**
"**For Providers:** Doctors can import a patient's Route ID into the Provider Dashboard to:
- View the complete care pathway
- Track progress in real-time
- Update service statuses
- See which services are completed, in progress, or pending"

**[2:20]**
"**The AI Component:** Our system uses advanced algorithms to optimize routes based on:
- Geographic proximity
- Service costs
- Insurance coverage
- Travel expenses
- Time efficiency"

**[2:35]**
"Plus, we've integrated AI recommendations that explain the route, suggest cost-saving tips, and provide health considerations - all powered by large language models."

**[2:50]**
"**Distance-Based Cost Calculation:** One of our most innovative features calculates travel costs based on actual distance. When a patient enters their address, the system geocodes it, calculates distances to each provider, and adds travel expenses to the total cost - giving patients complete transparency."

---

### [3:00 - 4:00] **Technical Highlights & Architecture**

**[3:00]**
"From a technical standpoint, ReferHarmony is built with modern, scalable architecture:"

**[3:05]**
"**Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, beautiful user interface"

**[3:10]**
"**Backend:** Node.js with Express for the main application, and a FastAPI microservice for route optimization"

**[3:15]**
"**Databases:** MongoDB for referral data, PostgreSQL for route optimization data"

**[3:20]**
"**AI Integration:** We support multiple LLM providers - OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama - for flexible AI recommendations"

**[3:25]**
"**Security:** JWT authentication, HIPAA-compliant audit logging, and encrypted environment variables"

**[3:30]**
"**Deployment:** Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment"

**[3:35]**
"The route optimization engine uses the A* algorithm - the same algorithm used in GPS navigation - but optimized for healthcare services, considering not just distance, but cost, time, and insurance coverage."

**[3:45]**
"We've also implemented address geocoding, so patients can simply enter their address and the system automatically calculates the most efficient route."

---

### [4:00 - 4:45] **Real-World Impact & Use Cases**

**[4:00]**
"Let me share a real-world scenario:"

**[4:05]**
"A patient in Joplin, Missouri needs multiple services covered by their Aetna Gold insurance. Instead of making multiple phone calls and driving to different locations, they:"

**[4:10]**
"1. Enter their information in Route Planner
2. Get an optimized route showing 3 services at 3 different providers
3. See total cost: $330 for services plus $3.75 for travel
4. Receive a Route ID: #42
5. Share that ID with their doctor"

**[4:25]**
"The doctor imports Route ID #42 and can now track the patient's progress through all three services in real-time, updating statuses as services are completed."

**[4:35]**
"This saves time, reduces confusion, improves care coordination, and gives everyone - patients and providers - complete visibility into the care journey."

---

### [4:45 - 5:00] **Closing & Call to Action**

**[4:45]**
"ReferHarmony represents the future of healthcare navigation - where technology removes barriers, AI optimizes care pathways, and transparency empowers patients."

**[4:50]**
"We're not just building software - we're building a bridge between patients and the care they need, making healthcare more accessible, affordable, and efficient."

**[4:55]**
"Thank you for your time. I'd be happy to answer any questions or provide a live demonstration."

**[5:00]**
"Thank you!"
